1. A GUI is a graphical user interface. GUI's typically contain frames, buttons, and text fields that are used to communicate with the user.

2. GUI's are able to communicate with the user through the use of event handler methods. A click of a button or pressing "Enter" after entering text in a text
field would be considered an event, which would run the code in the event handler method. 

3. Components can not be directly added onto a frame. They must be added onto a content pane like JPanel.

4. A JLabel cannot respond to an event because there is no way or reason to interact with it. A JLabel's purpose is to display information to the user, not receive
information from the user.

5. To provide a greater degree of insurance that events will run in the correct sequence and without error.

6. A JButton can respond to interaction from the user while the JLabel can not.
